# Key project 01: HTML page
Professional HTML Page

This project contains a webpage that is intended to be a digital copy of my current "paper" CV, which you can check out <a href="resources/original.pdf">here</a>, as a first exercise to get to know html and css. I tried to add some other items to experiment a little bit but I wanted to make it as close as possible to the original one, hence that is why it may look so simple and clear. I'm planning making a more complex portfolio including all my work during the course, so check out my profile in the future to find out how the project goes! :)
